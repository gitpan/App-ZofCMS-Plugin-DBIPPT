App-ZofCMS-Plugin-DBIPPT

The module is a plugin for L<App::ZofCMS> that provides 
means to automatically post-process some most common (at least for me)
post-processing needs when using L<App::ZofCMS::Plugin::DBI>; namely,
converting numerical output of C<time()> with C<localtime()> as well
as changing new lines in regular text data into C<br>s while escaping
HTML Entities.
